Welcome to Snal Linux
Simple Networked and Live

Snal is based on Arch linux <https://www.archlinux.org>, the i3 window manager <https://i3wm.org>, and Firefox web browser <https://www.mozilla.org>. It is intended to be used as a live USB image to troubleshoot hard disk, system, and network problems.

Snal is built using the archiso scripts from the archiso project, which is also used to build the official Arch ISO. The scripts were forked from archiso. Upstream changes are merged into Snal every few months.
