Welcome to Snal Linux
Simple Networked and Live

Snal is based on Arch linux <https://www.archlinux.org>, the i3 window manager <https://i3wm.org>, and Firefox web browser <https://www.mozilla.org>. It is intended to be used as a live USB image to troubleshoot hard disk, system, and network problems.


Current Release
This is Snal XXVERXX. It was released on XXDATEXX. It is available for download at <https://sourceforge.net/projects/snallinux/files/snallinux-XXVERXX.iso/download>


Burning a DVD
The Snal ISO can be burned to a DVD using standard software. The Snal image is approximately 1.5GB.


Copying to USB
The Snal ISO can also be transferred directly to a USB drive (at least 2 GB) using dd or similar software. See <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_flash_installation_media> for more information.


After bootup
After Snal boots, user snal is logged in automatically. The user is asked if she wants to run startx. Pressing enter will run the default: starting XWindows with i3 as the window manager. The options are as follows:

Entering "y" or just pressing enter will run startx with i3 as the window manager.
Entering "n" will run a bash shell.
Entering "s" will attach an existing screen session or start a new one.
Entering "x" will join an existing screen session.

xfce is also available. To use xfce, do not start XWindows, edit /home/snal/.xinitrc to exec startxfce4 instead of i3, then start XWindows.


Graphical Interface
The default Snal interface is the i3 window manager. Key bindings are shown on the background image and can be changed by editing /home/snal/.config/i3/config.

More information on the i3 window manager is available in 'man i3' and at <https://i3wm.org>.

A terminal emulator can be opened using super+enter. To see what other applications are available, press super+d to run rofi, which is a program launcher.


Command Line Interface
Snal features the GNU Screen terminal multiplexer. When a new terminal is opened, the user is asked if she wants to run screen. Pressing enter will run the default: attach or start. If a screen session exists, attach it here. If a screen session doesn't exist, start a new session. The options are as follows:

Entering "y" or just pressing enter will attach an existing screen session or start a new one.
Entering "n" will run a bash shell. 
Entering "x" will join an existing screen session.

Keybindings in GNU Screen consist of control+a followed by one additional character. For example, to detach screen from the terminal where it is running, press control+a control+d. These settings can be changed by editing /home/snal/.screenrc.

More information on GNU Screen is available in 'man screen' and at <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GNU_Screen>.


Login Information
The normal user is snal. The initial password is snal. Change it by running passwd.
The root password is root. Change it by running passwd as root.


Networking
To join a wireless network, run wifi-menu as root.
Wired networks can be configured by creating netctl profiles in /etc/netctl.

More information about netctl is available in 'man netctl' at <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Netctl>.


Installing
Since Snal is built using the Archiso scripts, you can install Arch from a running Snal. This is not recommended as Snal is not supported by the Arch community, but the Arch installation file is located at /root/install.txt.
