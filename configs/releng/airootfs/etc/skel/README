Welcome to Snal Linux
Simple Networked and Live

Snal is based on Arch linux <https://www.archlinux.org>, the i3 window manager <https://i3wm.org>, and Firefox web browser <https://www.mozilla.org>. It is intended to be used as a live USB image to troubleshoot hard disk, system, and network problems.


Current Release
This is a release candidate for Snal 0.4.

Snal 0.3 is the latest release. It was released on December 2, 2019. It is available for download at <https://sourceforge.net/projects/snallinux/files/snallinux-0.3.iso/download>


Burning a DVD
The Snal ISO can be burned to a DVD using standard software. As of release 0.4, the Snal image is approximately 1.3 GB.


Copying to USB
The Snal ISO can also be transferred directly to a USB drive using dd or similar software. See <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_flash_installation_media> for more information.


After bootup
After Snal boots, user snal is logged in automatically. The user is asked if she wants to run startx. Pressing enter will run the default: starting XWindows with i3 as the window manager. The options are as follows:

Entering "y" or just pressing enter will run startx with i3 as the window manager.
Entering "n" will run the standard command line user interface. In Snal, bash is the default shell.
Entering "s" will run gnu screen, which is a terminal multiplexer.
Entering "x" will run gnu screen, attempting to connect to an existing screen session.

xfce is also available. To use xfce, do not start XWindows, edit /home/snal/.xinitrc to exec startxfce4 instead of i3, then start XWindows.


Graphical Interface
The default Snal interface is the i3 window manager. Key bindings are shown on the background image and can be changed by editing /home/snal/.config/i3/config.

More information on the i3 window manager is available at <https://i3wm.org>.

A terminal emulator can be opened using super+enter. By default, the termite terminal emulator will ask to run GNU Screen on startup. This behavior can be changed by editing /home/snal/.bash_profile.

To see what other applications are available, press super+d to run rofi, which is a program launcher.


Command Line Interface
Snal features the GNU Screen terminal multiplexer. Screen keybindings consist of control+a followed by one additional character. For example, to detach screen from the terminal where it is running, press control+a control+d. These settings can be changed by editing /home/snal/.screenrc.

More information on GNU Screen is available at <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GNU_Screen>.


Login Information
The normal user is snal. The initial password is snal. Change it by running passwd.
The root password is root. Change it by running passwd as root.


Networking
To join a wireless network, run wifi-menu as root.
Wired networks can be configured by creating netctl profiles in /etc/netctl.

More information about netctl is available at <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Netctl>.


Installing
Since Snal is built using the Archiso scripts, you can install Arch from a running Snal. The Arch installation file is located at /root/install.txt.
