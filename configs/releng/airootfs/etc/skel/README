Welcome to Snal Linux
Simple Networked and Live

Snal is based on Arch linux (https://www.archlinux.org), the i3 window manager (https://i3wm.org), and Firefox web browser (https://www.mozilla.org). It is intended to be used as a live USB image to troubleshoot hard disk, system, and network problems.


After bootup
After Snal boots, user snal is logged in automatically. The user is asked if she wants to run startx. Pressing enter will run the default: starting XWindows with i3 as the window manager. The options are as follows:

Entering "y" or just pressing enter will run startx with i3 as the window manager.
Entering "n" will run the standard command line user interface. In Snal, bash is the default shell.
Entering "s" will run gnu screen, which is a terminal multiplexer.
Entering "x" will run gnu screen, attempting to connect to an existing screen session.

xfce is also available. To use xfce, edit /home/snal/.xinitrc to exec startxfce4 instead of i3.


Login information
The normal user is snal. The initial password is snal. Change it by running passwd.
The root password is root. Change it by running passwd as root.


Networking
To join a wireless network, run wifi-menu as root.
Wired networks can be configured by creating netctl profiles in /etc/netctl.


Installing
Since Snal is built using the Archiso scripts, you can install Arch from a running Snal. The Arch installation file is located at /root/install.txt.
