Welcome to Snal Linux
Simple Networked and Live

Snal is based on Arch linux (https://www.archlinux.org), the i3 window manager (https://i3wm.org), and Firefox web browser (https://www.mozilla.org).

When Snal boots, user snal is logged in automatically. The user is asked if she wants to run startx. The options are as follows:

y					yes (run startx)
n					no (run bash)
s					screen (run gnu screen)

The default is to run startx, which will start XWindows with i3 as the window manager.
